# React.js Project Assignment
Your task is to **design** and **implement** a web application using React.js. Use a service like Kinvey or Firebase for your **back-end** or create your own with Node.js and MongoDB or a framework in another language (ASP.NET, Spring, Symfony). It can be a **discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site, social network,** or any other web application of your choice. 

## 1.Application Structure
The application should have:
- [x] Public Part (Accessible without authentication) 
- [x] Private Part (Available for Registered Users)

### [x] 1.1 Public Part
The public part of your projects should be visible **without authentication.** This public part could be the application start page, the user login, and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g., the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.

### [x] 1.2 Private Part (User Area)
Registered users should have a personal area in the web application **accessible after successful login.** This area could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog system, the user's photos in a photo-sharing system, the user's contacts in a social network, etc.

## 2.General Requirements
Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks, and development techniques:
- [x] At least 3 different **dynamic pages** (pages like about, contacts, etc. do not count towards that figure)
- [] Must have specific **views:**
1. [x] **Catalog** – list of all created records
2. [x] **Details** – information about a specific record
- [x] At least one collection, different from the User collection, with all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
1. [x] **Logged in users** – create records and request to the REST API, interaction with the records (via Likes, Dislikes, Comments, etc.)
2. [x] **Logged in (author)** – to be able to Edit / Delete their records
3. [x] A **Guest** should have **access** to basic website **information** (catalog, details), but **not** to the functional **activities**
- [x] Use React.js for the **client-side**
- [x] Communicate to a **remote service** (via REST, sockets, GraphQL, or a similar client-server technique)
- [x] Implement **authentication**
- [x] Implement **client-side routing**
- [x] Demonstrate use of programming concepts, **specific to the React library:** stateless and state full components, bound forms, synthetic events, Component Styling, etc.
- [x] Use a **source control system,** like GitHub
- [x] **It is required to have committed in GitHub for at least 3 days**

## 3.Other requirements
- [] Apply **error handling** and **data validation** to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered
- [x] The application should be divided into **components** with **separate CSS files.**
- [] Brief **documentation** on the project and project architecture (as .md file)
- [x] Demonstrate use of programming concepts - React Hooks, Context API

## 4.Public Project Defense
Each student will have to deliver a **public defense** of their work in front of the other students, trainers, and assistants. Students will have **only 20 minutes** for the following:
- [] **Demonstrate** how the application works (very shortly)
- [] Show the **source code** and explain how it works
- [] Answer **questions**

Please be **strict in the timing!** In the **20th** minute, you **will be interrupted!** It is a good idea to leave **the last 5 minutes for questions.**

Be **well prepared** to present the maximum of your work for the minimum amount of time. Open **the project assets** beforehand to save time.

## 5.Bonuses
- [] Use a **state management** solution (React Redux) instead of Context API
- [] Write **Unit Tests** for your code
- [] Good UI and UX
- [] Use a **file storage cloud API,** e.g., **Dropbox, Google Drive,** or other for storing the files
- [] Connect to an external API, like Google Maps, AccuWeather, etc.
- [] **Deploy the application** in a cloud (Heroku, Firebase)
- [] **Bonuses depend on the complexity of the implementation**
- [] Anything that is not described in the assignment is a bonus if it has some practical use

## 6.Assessment Criteria
### General Requirements – 50 %
Implementing all the general requirements will grant you a place on the defense schedule. All projects that do not have the general requirements will not be accepted for defense.

### Other Requirements – 20 % 

### Functionality Presentation – 10 %
Adequately demonstrate the requested functionality. Know your way around the application and quickly demonstrate the code.

### Answering Questions – 20 %
Answer questions about potential functionality outside the scope of the project.

### Bonuses – up to 10 %
Additional functionality or libraries outside the general requirements, with motivated usage.

## 7.Submission Deadline
You **must** submit your project before 23:59 on **10 Dec** using a survey that will show up on **6 Dec.** A presentation schedule will be available on **15 Dec** and will include only the projects that were **submitted beforehand. Non-submitted projects will NOT be evaluated.**

## 8.Restrictions
You can use **parts** (some components, routing configurations, form validation, etc...) of the **course workshop**, but you are **NOT** allowed to use the **whole workshop** as your project assignment. You are **NOT** allowed to use **HTML & CSS** structures from **JS Back-End** and **JS Applications** Courses.

## 9.Project Challenge
The **best three projects** will win a discount for the next course or module:
First place – 80% discount voucher
Second place – 50% discount voucher
Third place – 30% discount voucher
The ranking of the projects is done **based only on the submitted project** (it does not include the assessment of the theoretical exam). The voucher could be used for **one course or one module in the open or the professional program at SoftUni**. It **cannot be divided** into parts or **given to another person**. The voucher is valid for **one year** after the announcement of the winners.
